### Visuals! More explicit Readme's in the appropriate folders.
- As it stands, it seems using HeavyM (Free trial, not sure of limitations) to do projection mapping looks like a good idea. It seems really simple to set up on the fly and anyone who wants to have some fun with it, can learn it in minutes. (untested as yet) https://heavym.net/en/ 
AND OR TOUCHDESIGNER https://derivative.ca/ I'll look into both over the holiday *SirLucian

- LEDs (something like the WS2812B's probably) will be controlled using Teensy boards with the OCTOWS. This enables us to control thousands of LEDs. Can load Arduino stuff on there and let her rip. For testing purposes, just write for Arduino and test at home with smaller lengths and the Arduinos you probably have lying around anyway. We'll scale this all up later. (for an example of how to do this, check out the Party Box Basic https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Party-Box-Basic-Spin-Your-Disco-Ball-and-More/ *excuse my shameless self promotion. at least i'm not selling anything)

- Coded and generative visuals: Code stuff in Processing or other such things and we can use it for the projection mapping or even pipe it into lasers :D
