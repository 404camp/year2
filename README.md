### Visuals! More explicit Readme's in the appropriate folders.
- As it stands, it seems using HeavyM (Free trial, not sure of limitations) to do projection mapping looks like a good idea. It seems really simple to set up on the fly and anyone who wants to have some fun with it, can learn it in minutes. (untested as yet) https://heavym.net/en/ 

- LEDs (something like the WS2812B's probably) will be controlled using Teensy boards with the OCTOWS. This enables us to control thousands of LEDs. Can load Arduino stuff on there and let her rip. 

- Coded and generative visuals: Code stuff in Processing or other such things and we can use it for the projection mapping or even pipe it into lasers :D
